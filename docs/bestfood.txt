best foods to eat for diabetes
Here are some of the best foods to eat for diabetes:

Non-starchy vegetables: These vegetables are low in calories and carbohydrates, but high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Some examples include broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, celery, cucumber, eggplant, greens (such as kale and spinach), green beans, mushrooms, onions, peppers, tomatoes, and zucchini.
Fruits: Fruits are a good source of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. However, they also contain carbohydrates, so it is important to choose fruits that are lower in sugar. Some good options include berries, citrus fruits, apples, and pears.
Whole grains: Whole grains are a good source of complex carbohydrates, fiber, and other nutrients. They also tend to have a lower glycemic index (GI) than refined grains, meaning they cause blood sugar levels to rise more slowly. Some examples of whole grains include brown rice, quinoa, oats, whole-wheat bread, and whole-wheat pasta.
Lean protein: Lean protein sources, such as beans, lentils, tofu, fish, chicken, and turkey, are important for people with diabetes because they can help control blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of heart disease.
Healthy fats: Healthy fats, such as those found in olive oil, nuts, and avocados, can help improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of heart disease.
Here are some specific examples of healthy and delicious meals and snacks for people with diabetes:

Breakfast: Oatmeal with berries and nuts, whole-wheat toast with avocado and egg, yogurt parfait with fruit and granola
Lunch: Salad with grilled chicken or fish, whole-wheat wrap with hummus and vegetables, lentil soup
Dinner: Salmon with roasted vegetables, quinoa bowl with black beans and avocado, chicken stir-fry with brown rice
Snacks: Fruits and vegetables with nuts, hard-boiled eggs, yogurt
It is important to note that everyone's dietary needs are different, so it is important to talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian to create a meal plan that is right for you.
